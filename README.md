Here, we trained a deep learning based LSTM model for predicting the future price of bitcoin.
As we know, bitcoin is a very volatile cryptocurrency and its price fluctuates unevenly, making difficult 
for the investors and traders to predict its future price and hence facing loss. So, as a solution to the 
problem, our team has put an effort in making a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network 
machine learning price prediction model for bitcoin which is able to predict the next day future price 
with an accuracy about 95% after multi training and testing. The code was committed using Google Colab software platform.
